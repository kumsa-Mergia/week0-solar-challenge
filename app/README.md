# 🌞 Cross-Country Solar Potential Comparison Dashboard

This **Streamlit dashboard** provides a visual and statistical comparison of solar energy potential across **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo**. The app utilizes cleaned datasets to analyze and compare key solar metrics, helping users identify the most promising regions for solar energy development.

## ☀️ Key Solar Metrics Analyzed

- **GHI** – Global Horizontal Irradiance
- **DNI** – Direct Normal Irradiance
- **DHI** – Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance
